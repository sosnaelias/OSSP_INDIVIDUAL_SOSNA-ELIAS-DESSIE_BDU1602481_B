system call

This repository includes an implementation of the settimeofday() system call on Linux Mint, written in C. The program sets the system clock to a user-defined time by creating and populating a timeval structure. It demonstrates the use of system-level privileges required to modify system time and provides appropriate error handling. The implementation serves as a practical example of interacting with low-level time management APIs in Linux. This example highlights how administrators and developers can programmatically control time settings, which is crucial for tasks such as time synchronization, testing, and system recovery.
